# Responsive-Photo-Gallery-Project
This project is a responsive, accessible photo gallery built with HTML and CSS as part of the Coursera Final Project. It adapts to mobile, tablet, and large screens using a mobile-first approach and media queries. The design respects user preferences such as reduced motion and dark color schemes, and follows accessibility best practices.
